# javascript and classes
- Yes, JavaScript does indeed have classes. JavaScript introduced the concept of classes in ECMAScript 2015 (also known as ES6). Classes in JavaScript are syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. They provide a more familiar and convenient syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance.

## OOP (Object-oriented programming)
- its is an programming paradim

## Object
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## why use OOP

## parts of OOP
Object literal 

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)


## 4 pillars
- Abstraction: The process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on relevant characteristics and ignoring irrelevant details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity and building more understandable and maintainable code.

- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (an object), and restricting access to some of the object's components. This helps in hiding the internal state of an object and only exposing the necessary functionality.

- Inheritance: Defining new classes based on existing classes (superclasses or base classes) to inherit their attributes and methods. This allows for code reuse and promotes a hierarchical organization of classes.

- Polymorphism: The ability for different objects to respond to the same message (method call) in different ways. This allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
